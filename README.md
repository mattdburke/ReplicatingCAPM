# ReplicatingCAPM
Basic replication of the CAPM model in R

This code runs a very basic test of CAPM. 

For each firm in the dataset, I estimate their beta. Similarly I then estimate their average monthly return over the period.

I allocate these values to a new dataset, df2.

With this I then estimate the securities market line.
